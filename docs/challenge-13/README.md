# NEAR StakeWars III - Challenge-13

> In this challenge, participants will learn how to update their node, migrate keys, and set up a BACKUP node.

> Please note that this challenge includes multiple parts:
> - Best Practices: is an informational section that outlines the optimal way of updating a validator node (no points)
> - Task: in this section, participants will learn how to migrate validator keys. Only this part of the challenge will be evaluated. (25 UNP & 10 DNP)

## Running the backup node ###

### 1. Reserved validator and backup keys (idtcn3)

### 2. Start backup script `run/start-as-backup.sh`
~~~
#!/bin/bash
# Stops the node and disables the current keys replacing them 
# with the reserve keys so it can NOT run as validator 
# then restarts the node as backup

# stop it before doing anything
echo "\n$(date): Stopping neard now ..."
sudo systemctl stop neard
sudo systemctl status neard

# workdir
cd ~/.near

# copy the backup node key to assure we are not using the previous one
# dont need to preserve previous keys cause we already have them stored
echo "\n\n$(date): Deleting validator key and replacing node key ..."
cp -v ~/keys/backup/backup_node_key.json node_key.json
cat node_key.json | jq

# disable validator_key so it can not run as validator even if it restarts
rm -v inactive_validator_key.*
cp -v validator_key.json inactive_validator_key.json
rm -v validator_key.json

# we are done ... 
DATE=$(date)
echo "\n\n$(date): Restart neard now ..."
echo "$(date): Disabled as validator, node running as BACKUP"
sudo systemctl start neard
sudo systemctl status neard
~~~

## Start failover node as validator (idtcn3)

### 1. Start validator script `run/start-as-validator.sh`

~~~
#!/bin/bash
# Stops the backup node and restarts it as validator 
# replacing keys with the validator keys
POOLID=$1

# stop it before doing anything
echo "\n$(date): Stopping neard now ..."
sudo systemctl stop neard
sudo journalctl -n 300 -u neard | ccze -A | grep INFO

# workdir
cd ~/.near

# copy the validator keys to ~/.near
# no need to save backup key, we already have them stored 
echo "\n\n$(date): Copy validator and node keys ..."
cp -v ~/keys/validators/"${POOLID}_node_key.json" node_key.json
cat validator_key.json | jq
cp -v ~/keys/validators/"${POOLID}_validator_key.json" validator_key.json
cat node_key.json | jq

# we are done ... can restart
echo "\n\n$(date): Restart neard now ..."
echo "$(date): This node is now ACTIVE as **${POOLID}** pool"
sudo systemctl restart neard
sudo journalctl -n 50 -f -u  neard | ccze -A | grep INFO
~~~
